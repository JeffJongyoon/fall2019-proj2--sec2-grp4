+ **Project summary**: Trees are essential to the well-being of humans living in cities. They help regulate the temperature, they filter the air, and lower the overall noise level. Especially in times of climate change, trees in cities are perceived an essential element to ensure sustainability.
The NYC Tree App is designed for the ‘NYC Street Tree Caring Program’, which is a volunteer program that intends to help better preserve and protect the street trees of New York City. This App allows more convenient ways to locate trees, identify specific tree problems, and spot additional threats to trees from surrounding environment.
In recent years, dogs pose an increasing threat to the health of trees (https://www.ltoa.org.uk/resources/dog-damage-to-trees). Our research indicates that dogs can harm trees in certain ways. Due to this fact, the App enables volunteers with insides into how many dogs are registered in a certain Zip code in NYC, helping the volunteers to take protective measures.
